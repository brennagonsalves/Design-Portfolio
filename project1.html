  <!--The Problem-->
    <section class="problem">
      <h4>The Problem</h4>
      <p>There has been an abrupt shift to a remote service model for rehabilitation therapies since the COVID19 outbreak. The lack of physical office spaces creates some headaches for therapists.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>1. Therapy daily tasks are accomplished on different platforms</li>
            <li>2. Session prep is time consuming, requiring work off the clock</li>
            <li>3. Hard to collaborate with multi-disciplinary team outside of the office space</li>
          </ol>
    </section>

  <!--The Solution-->
    <section class="solution">
      <div>
        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>TheraShelf streamlines the most important therapy tasks while promoting collaboration with the multi-disciplinary team. TheraShelf's benefits are three fold, positively impacting everyone involved in the therapy process. Let's take a closer look: </p>

  <!--Surveys-->
    <section class="surveys" id="discovery-phase">
      <h4>Surveys</h4>
      <p>A survey was conducted to gain a better understanding of user experiences with cloud storage products on the market. The qualitative data collected about motivations, pain points, etc. would drive design decisions down the road. Important findings include:</p>

  <!--Competitive Analysis-->

        <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>

        <img class="logos-mobile" src="images/mobile-logos.svg" alt="Competitor's Logos">
        <p>Google Docs and Dropbox provide the largest array of features that could be used for therapy tasks. However, none of these features address therapist's needs head on. There is still a considerable amount of effort required by the user to accomplish healthcare goals.</p>
        <p>Constant therapy is designed for the therapy population, but it's primary function is to provide therapy materials to the clients. There are no collaboration or content customization features.</p>

        </div>
        <h4>Where do we go from here?</h4>
        <p>I was able to carve out some actionable insights from the data collected from the surveys and analysis of current cloud storage products. Key takeaways include:
        <h5>1. Untapped Market</h5>
        <p>There is a huge potential market for therapists who now work remotely. Design a product to appeal to the new market while solving the major pain points of current cloud storage users.</p>
        <h5>2. Smart Scheduling</h5>
        <p>Streamline access to visit schedules, visit types, and client records. These therapy tasks eat up a significant amount of therapist's time. Creating inuitive user flows will improve time management and productivity.</p>
        <h5>3. Consolidate Therapy Tasks</h5>
        <p>There are currently no cloud storage products on the market that account for all the most important therapy tasks. Including the right combination of features will separate this product from competitors.</p>

  <!--Personas-->
    <section class="personas">
      <div>
        <h4>Creating User Personas</h4>
        <p>I developed personas to represent an inclusive and full spectrum representation of potential TheraShelf users. The personas were referenced frequently during the design process to maintain true user emapthy.</p>
      </div>
      <img class="personas-img"src="images/personas.svg" alt="personas">
    </section>

  <!--User Stories-->
    <section class="user-stories" id="information-architecture">
      <h4>User Stories</h4>
      <p>I wrote user stories to account for the most important features per survey and SWOT analysis results. These stories were used to create the MVP that would eventually move into usability testing. High priority stories include:</p>
      <ul class="list-items">
        <li>I want to view today's schedule</li>
        <li> I want to add a new visit</li>
        <li>I want to view client medical records</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

  <!--User Flows-->
    <section class="user-flows">
      <h4>User Flows</h4>
      <p>I created user flows to represent how a user would interact with TheraSelf to accomplish the high priority user stories. From there, a site map was created to help organize the destinations for each of the user flows.</p>

    <!--Branding-->
      <section class="branding" id="branding">
        <h4>Making the Brand</h4>
        <p>The overall feel of the brand is intended to promote healing, growth, and calmness. This is achieved through a color palette comprised primarily of blue and green tones. Geometric fonts and clean icons also communicate simplicity throughout the product.</p>

      </section>

  <!--Sketches-->
    <section class="sketches">
      <h4>Sketches</h4>
      <p>It was finally time to put pen to paper. I started by sketching out possible layouts for the product pages based on the user flows. Rapid iterations allowed me to work through some initial design challenges in a quick and efficient manner.</p>
      <figure>
        <img class="sketches" src="images/sketches.jpg" alt="sketches">
        <figcaption>Rapid iterations with initial sketches</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>

  <!--Wireframes-->
    <section class="wireframes">
      <h4>Wireframes</h4>
      <p>Using my sketches for reference, I created digital wireframes in Figma. The dashboard serves as an anchor point for product navigation. The user flow was designed to mirror an intuitive therapy process, starting with chart review and ending with visit scheduling.</p>
      <figure>
        <img class="wireframe-sizing" src="images/wireframes.png" alt="Wireframes">
        <figcaption>Iteration 1: Accessing charts and scheduling</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>

  <!--User Testing One-->
    <section class="user-testing">
      <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
      <p>Remote usability testing was completed with several participants to assess the effectiveness of collective design decisions up to this point. Let's take a look at some user feedback and subsequent design revisions.</p>
      <h5>Problem 1: Inefficient dashboard configuration</h5>
      <p>It took users longer than anticipated to locate high priority features. There were wasteful clicks around the dashboard page before reaching the medical records. The extra time searching through the dashbard hinders therapy productivity.</p>
      <h5>Iteration 2</h5>
      <p>Dashboard elements were reconfigured to better communicate hierarchy of information. A hamburger menu replaces the bottom toolbar to use space more effectively and eliminate ambiguous toolbar buttons. A card layout was added to the middle of the page for direct access to high priority features. Color and images were used to draw the eye and add function clarity.</p>
        <figure>
          <img class="revisions" src="images/client-records-2.png" alt="Usability Testing">
          <figcaption>Dashboard page before and after user testing</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h5>Problem 2: Time consuming diagnostics</h5>
        <p>It took too long for users to identify the most important diagnostic information from client medical records. The full scale reports are lengthy to read and take up too much space on the medical record screen.</p>
        <h5>Iteration 2</h5>
        <p>The medical records summary tab now highlights key diagnostics like standardized tests and diagnoses at a quick glance. The full length version of each assessment may be viewed under a separate tab when therapists have extra time. These revisions improve the communication flow between the multi-disciplinary team.</p>
        <figure>
          <img class="revisions" src="images/testing-revisions-2.png" alt="Usability Testing">
          <figcaption>Medical records before and after user testing</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h5>Problem 3: Slow scheduling process</h5>
        <p>The schedule page from the first iteration requires a significant amount of free typing. Therapists may also have to navigate back to a different page to double check information like proper spelling of names.</p>
        <h5>Iteration 2</h5>
        <p>The entire scheduling process now requires just a few clicks to complete. Free typing information is minimized, saving time and decreasing the chance of errors. It streamlines scheduling by allowing therapist to select only available time slots for their new visit. </p>

  <!--Prototyping & Testing-->
    <section class="prototyping" id="visual-design">
      <div>
        <h4>Prototyping & Preference Testing</h4>
        <p>A high fidelity prototype was created in Figma. I was careful to include the visual elements defined by the branding guidlines and revisions from the first round of user testing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="preference-testing">
        <p>I considered different configurations for the menu on the client overview page. Preference testing was completed to see which visual element was preferred for this product. Users chose between a slide feature or tab menu to highlight content pages during navigation.</p>
        <figure>
          <img class="revisions" src="images/preference-testing.png" alt="Preference Testing">
          <figcaption>Screens presented during preference testing</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The majority of users preferred the slide feature (left image) since it was clearer and more eye catching compared to the tab menu. The design element was implemented throughout the product.</p>
      </div>

      <!--final prototype-->
      <section class="final-prototype">
        <h4> The Final Design</h4>
        <p> TheraShelf underwent some minor and major changes to its design elements and layout. At the end of the day, TheraShelf finds its place amoungst other cloud storage products by targeting a niche health care audience. It provides creative solutions to our new remote world. </p>

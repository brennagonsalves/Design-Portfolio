      <h3>Right Neighborhood, Wrong Street</h3>
      <p>I wanted a career where I could work with people, use my natural empathy, and be a creative problem solver. No, I didn’t jump right into the field of UX design. I got my Master’s degree in Communication Sciences and became a medical Speech Pathologist. </p>
      <p>Three years later, I was using those important skills and I was good at my job. So why was I feeling like something was missing? It turns out Speech Therapy put me in the right neighborhood, but I was on the wrong street. </p>
      <p>I'm grateful for the Speech Therapy field, not just for the transferable skills I learned, but because it led me directly to UX design. We were required to document in an Electronic Medical Record system that was the definition of poor user experience. I eventually volunteered to work with the web development team to redesign the entire documentation system. The rest was history.</p>

      <h6>An in-service I facilitated as a clinician. </h6>
      <p>I enrolled in an immersive UX design apprenticeship to acquire those important design-specific skills. As mentioned earlier, I still pull from my experiences and skills as a Speech-Pathologist. But now I am able to marry technical skills, design aesthetics, and empathy to create real solutions for people. </p>
      <p>To me, UX design is more than just creating products. It is about truly understanding people and their needs to make impactful solutions that really count. The future is digital and I am excited to have a hand in shaping that future. </p>

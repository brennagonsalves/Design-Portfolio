        <h1>Catalyst</h1>
        <p>Catalyst is a learning product that creates a space for those with an interest in the sciences. Its strategic array of makes science learning simple, fun, and effective.</p>

  <!--The Problem-->
    <section class="problem">
      <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
      <p>Currently, there are limited options for learning products with a focus on the sciences. Those with an interest in STEM topics are having trouble finding interesting and relevant content. When they do, they are having difficulty staying motivated to get through the content on their own.</p>
    </section>

  <!--the solution preview-->
  <section class="solution">
    <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
    <h2>Catalyst is a STEM learning product that offers personalized recommendations and tracks progress towards learning goals.</h2>

    <!--surveys-->
      <section class="surveys">
        <h4>SURVEYS</h4>
        <p>I created a survey with questions about user's experiences, perceptions, and attitudes towards learning products. I also included questions geared specifically towards STEM topics. Some interesting findings include:</p>

  <!--Competitive Analysis-->
      <section class="competitive-analysis">
        <h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
        <p>I took a closer look at three learning products that are currently on the market. I wanted to analyze the behaviors of competitors and assess different approaches to learning products.</p>
        <img src="images/competitor-logos-catalyst.svg" alt="competitor logos">
        <h5>Strengths</h5>
        <p>Duolingo and Lumosity are the most comparable to the concept of Catalyst. They both have strong branding and fun UI elements that are interesting to users. Both incorporate course tracking and variable reward systems to keep users motivated. YouTube provides smart recommendations to users based on interactions with the product.</p>
        <h5>Weaknesses</h5>
        <p>Competitors only offer vague course descriptions and lack metrics (like reviews) that are relevant to users when browsing for content. After enrolling, users can only progress linearly and there are no options to personalize content based on individual interests. </p>

      <!--take aways-->
      <section class="insights">
        <h4 class="insight-title">ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS</h4>
        <div class="insight-one">
          <h1>Engage</h1>
          <p>Fun, bright visual elements to pique user interest without sacrificing functionality</p>
        </div>
        <div class="insight-two">
          <h1>Inform</h1>
          <p>Detailed but concise course and lesson overviews to meet user expectations</p>
        </div>
        <div class="insight-three">
          <h1>Retain</h1>
          <p>Keep users excited to learn with progress tracking and extrinsic motivators like achievements</p>
        </div>
      </section>

  <!--User Flows-->
      <section class="user-flows">
        <h4>USER FLOWS</h4>
        <p>I created user flows to represent how a user would interact with Catalyst's most important features. From there, a site map was created to help organize the destinations for each of the user flows. Below, you will find the user flow to review courses and access lesson content.</p>

      </section>

  <!--Sketches-->
      <section class="sketches">
        <h4>SKETCHES</h4>
        <p>I made rapid iteration sketches to explore different configurations for my product pages. I was able to mitigate potentional breakdowns in user flows. I also gained a clearer direction for the overall function and design of the product.</p>

      </section>

  <!--Wireframes-->
      <section class="wireframes">
        <h4>WIREFRAMES</h4>
        <p>I created digital wireframes in Figma using my sketches and user flows for reference. Wireframes were compiled to represent how users can accomplish the most important product tasks. The high priority features include browsing content, adding courses, and completing lesson content. Let's take a look at the first iterations.</p>

          <figure class="wireframe-set-three">

      </section>

    <!--final design-->
      <h4>HIGH FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h4>
      <p>I breathed life into my wireframes by applying the color palette, illustrations, and other visual elements. Improvements were made to the overall functionality of the product well. Let's take a look at the evolution of Catalyst in the next iteration.</p>
      <section class="solution-one">
        <div class="solution-text">
          <h4>Browse & Add Courses</h4>
          <p> Users are free to browse a content feed with tailored recommendations based on interests and preferences. Comprehensive course previews provides all the information a users needs to feel confident enrolling in a course. From there, users may continue to browse content or access the new and in progress courses from the toolbar.</p>

        </video>
        <div class="solution-one-changes">
          <h5>Key Design Changes</h5>
          <p>I reconfigured the content feed on the homepage to include category filters. I used larger cards to emphasis recommended content. This organization is more logical than the original grid display. It will make content browsing less cumbersome while saving the user time and effort.</p>

      </section>

      <section class="solution-two">
        <div class="solution-text-two">
          <h4>Accessing Lesson Content</h4>
          <p>New and in progress courses are easily accessed from the toolbar. Each course page comes equipped with a full breakdown of learning modules. You'll also notice simple but effective progress features in both the master list and individual course overviews to help users stay on track. </p>

        </video>
        <div class="solution-two-changes">
          <h5>Key Design Changes</h5>
          <p>The second iteration of the lesson overview page now mirrors the configuration of the course overview for better consistency. The use of accordian tabs eliminates the need for the user to navigate to a different page to see the content included in a particular lesson. It also allows space for collaboration features like forums.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="solution-three">
        <div class="solution-text-three">
          <h4>Knowledge Check</h4>
          <p>Users navigate to either quizzes or interactive games at the completion of each lesson to make sure they understand the major concepts. The illustrations are designed to be fun and bright to keep users engaged in their learning. After submitting an answer, the user receives specific feedback about each question to reinforce key learning concepts.</p>
        </div>
        <video class="solution-threevid" width="300" height="550" controls autoplay loop muted>

            <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.</p>
        </video>
        <div class="solution-three-changes">
          <h5>Key Design Changes</h5>
          <p>I noticed there was no feedback when selecting quiz answers during knowledge checks. This is a major pain point for users and could pose a threat to retention long term. In the second iteration, the submission button remains in an inactive state until users select an answer. The background color of the selected response changes to a light green. This is a simple and effective method to improve navigation feedback without distracting from the content itself.</p>

      <section class="concluding-thoughts">
        <h4>CONCLUDING THOUGHTS</h4>
        <p>I kept the scope of the Catalyst prototype relatively narrow for purposes of this case study. There's room to include additional screens (like the updated dashboard with category filters applied) to improve the overall functionality of the product. Applying animations throughout the product would elevate Catalyst to the next level as well.</p>

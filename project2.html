      <p>Designing a learning product from the ground up</p>
    </section>

  <!--The Problem-->
    <section class="problem">
      <h4>The Problem</h4>
      <p>There are limited options for learning products designed exclusively for STEM topics. Those that exist lack full scale features users are looking for. Users are having trouble:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>1. Searching for personalized science courses and content</li>
            <li>2. Tracking progress towards course and learning goals</li>
            <li>3. Staying motivated to finish self-paced courses</li>
          </ol>
    </section>

  <!--The Solution-->
    <section class="solution">
        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>Catalyst is a self-paced learning product that makes STEM education both fun and engaging. It offers specialized recommendations, tracks learning goals, and rewards users for completing learning objectives. Let's take a look: </p>

    <!--Case Study Segments-->
      <section class="roles">
        <h4>My Roles</h4>
        <p>I was solely responsible for the research, user experience, user interface, and branding elements of this product. I collaborated weekly with a senior design mentor who provided guidance and feedback during each design phase. </p>
      </section>

    <!--surveys-->
      <section class="roles">
        <h4>Surveys & Interviews</h4>
        <p>I created a survey made up of questions about user's experiences, perceptions, and attitudes towards learning products. I also included questions geared specifically towards STEM topics. Some interesting finding include:</p>

      </section>

  <!--Competitive Analysis-->
    <section class="competitive-analysis">
        <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
        <p>I took a closer look at three learning products that are currently on the market. I wanted to analyze the behaviors of competitors and assess different approaches to learning products.</p>
        <img class="logos-large" src="images/competitor-logos-catalyst.svg" alt="Competitor's Logos">
        <h5>Strengths</h5>
        <p>Duolingo and Lumosity are the most comparable to the concept of Catalyst. They both have strong branding and fun UI elements that are interesting to users. Both also incorporate course tracking and variable reward systems to keep users motivated. YouTube provides smart recommendations to users based on interactions within the product.</p>
        <h5>Weaknesses</h5>
        <p>Competitors only offer vague course descriptions and lack metrics (like reviews) that are relevant to users while content browsing. After enrolling, users can only progress linearly and there are no options to personalize content based on specific user interests. </p>

        </div>
        <h4>The Key Takeaways</h4>
        <p>I used the data collected from the survey and competitive analysis to outline some actionable insights. Catalyst will find success by incorporating:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>1. Fun, engaging visuals without sacrificing functionality</li>
          <li>2. Detailed but concise course overviews and progress tracking</li>
          <li>3. Extrinsic motivators for improved user engagement and retention</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

  <!--User Flows-->
    <section class="user-flows">
      <h4>User Flows</h4>
      <p>I created user flows to represent how a user would interact with TheraSelf to accomplish the high priority user stories. From there, a site map was created to help organize the destinations for each of the user flows.</p>
      <figure>
        <img class="flow-image" src="images/user-flows-catalyst.png" alt="User Flows">
        <figcaption>User Flows: reviewing and accessing courses</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>

  <!--Sketches-->
    <section class="sketches">
      <h4>Sketches</h4>
      <p>I made rapid iteration sketches to explore different configurations for my product pages. I was able to mitigate potentional breakdowns in user flows and gained a clearer direction for the overall function and design of the product.</p>
      <figure>
        <img class="sketches" src="images/sketches-catalyst.jpg" alt="sketches">
        <figcaption>Initial sketches</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </section>

  <!--Wireframes-->
    <section class="wireframes">
      <h4>Wireframes</h4>
      <p>Using my user flows and sketches as points of reference, I created wireframes in Figma. Wireframes were compiled to represent how users can accomplish the most important product tasks.   I was able to identify some inconsistencies and breakdowns in userflow that will be remedied in my mockups.</p>
      <h5>Adding a Course</h5>
        <p>Users browse content from a course feed on the home page. A course description and lesson overview display when a specific course is selected. After adding a course, users return to the home page where they are able to browse for additional content or select the learn tab from the toolbar to begin course content.</p>
      <figure class="image-sizing">
        <img src="images/wireframes-one-catalyst.png" alt="Wireframes">
        <figcaption>Iteration 1: Adding a Course</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h5>Accessing Lesson Content</h5>
      <p>Each course has a content page where individual lessons are selected. Users review the lesson content and key learning points before navigating to quizzes or interactive games for knowledge checks.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
    </section>

    <!--mockups-->
    <section class="mockups">
      <h4>Mockups</h4>
      <p>At this point, I breathed life into my wireframes by applying the color palette, illustrations, and other visual elements. Overall functionality was improved upon as well through. Let's take a look at the evolution of Catalyst across the different iterations.</p>
      <h5>Homepage Configuration</h5>
      <p>There was not much logic to the grid display of course content in the wireframe. The second iteration sees the addition of category filters and places greater emphasis on personalized recommendations. Both of these features save the user time and effort.</p>
      <figure class="quiz-sizing">
        <img src="images/catalyst-revisions.png" alt="Homepage Iterations">
        <figcaption>Homepage Configurations</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h5>Lesson Overview</h5>
      <p>The second iteration of the lesson overview page now mirrors the configuration of the course overview for improved consistency. It uses expandble accordian tabs to house comprehensive progress tracking information. I was also able to incorporate collaborative features, like forums, by using space more effectively above the lesson breakdown.</p>

  <!--User Testing One-->
    <section class="user-testing">
      <h4>Prototyping & Testing</h4>
      <p>With the preliminary revisions in place, I went on to create a clickable, interactive prototype. I then conducted remote usability testing with a handful of users. Their feedback shaped the subsequent modifications to Catalyst.</p>
      <h5>Poor feedback during quizzes</h5>
      <p>Users reported a lack of feedback while interacting with quiz pages. Specifically, there was no feedback when selecting answers to quiz questions. This was confusing to users and caused an unintended breakdown in the flow between lesson content and knowledge checks. These frustrations could pose an issue with user retention long term.</p>
      <figure class="quiz-sizing">
        <img src="images/testing-revisions-3-catalyst.png" alt="Second Iteration">
        <figcaption>Iteration 1: Answering Quiz Questions</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h5>Iteration 2</h5>
      <p>As users proceed to the lesson quiz, the submission button remains in an inactive state until users select a response. The background color of the selected response changes to a light green. This is a simple and effective method to improve navigation feedback without distracting from the content itself.</p>

    <!--final design-->
    <section class="final-design">
      <h4>Putting It All Together</h4>
      <p>Catalyst underwent several rounds of informed and strategic revisions to both function and design. Let's take a look at the product in action.</p>
    </section>

      <!--final prototype-->
      <section class="final-prototype">
        <video width="350" height="600" controls autoplay loop muted>

            <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.</p>
        </video>
      </section>

      <section class="concluding-thoughts">
        <h4>Concluding Thoughts</h4>
        <p>I kept the scope of the Catalyst prototype relatively narrow for purposes of this case study. There's room to include additional screens (like the updated dashboard with category filters applied) to improve the overall functionality of the product. Applying animations throughout the product would elevate Catalyst to the next level as well.</p>
